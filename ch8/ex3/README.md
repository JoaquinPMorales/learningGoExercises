Write a generic singly linked list data type. Each element can hold a comparable value and has a pointer to the next element in the list. The methods to implement are as follows:

// adds a new element to the end of the linked list
Add(T)
// adds an element at the specified position in the linked list
Insert(T, int)
// returns the position of the supplied value, -1 if it's not present
Index (T) int
